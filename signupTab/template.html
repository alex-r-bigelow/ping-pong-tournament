<p class="cantSignup">Unfortunately, you've missed the sign up deadline. However, you are still free to place bets.</p>
<p>We're doing a donation-based ping pong tournament. It works like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Sign up to play</b>
    <p>Pick a charity that you'll represent. If you win, your charity gets everyone's donations!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Bet on a player / charity combo</b>
    <p>Pick a player you think will win, or a charity that someone else is representing that you want to support.
      Show your support by betting on them! There's no deadline / limit on the number of times you can bet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All donations are on the honor system; leave your donation(s) in the box by the ping pong table.
  We encourage a <b>small</b> donation (the recommended amount is $1), but feel free to donate
  however much you like.
  If we've locked it away for the night, or you don't happen to have $1 on you, you can
  still sign upâ€”just try to remember to donate later. &#128521;
